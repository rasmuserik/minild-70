Show the smiley the way to walk through the dungeon.

I went for the usual Ludum Dare compo rules: 48 hours, single person, no premade assets, etc.

Written from scratch in ClojureScript
(no game engine, just Reagent/React and lisp).

Graphics are designed such that the game can be ported to pebble smartwatch later on, - i.e. low resolution black/white display.
